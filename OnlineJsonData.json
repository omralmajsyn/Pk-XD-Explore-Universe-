Once you create a character, you can start decorating your house, which has three rooms and a hallway.  Many of the basic items for your house are free, so you can create a great home without spending much of the in-game currency. That being said, as you play you can earn money and buy furniture, clothes, accessories and other unique items to create a complete custom character and home, which you can edit at any point during the game.  But there's more than just your home in PK-XD, there's an entire online world to explore.  Visit other player's homes, chat with them, stroll around the city, buy food, go to parties, and much, much more.
